.. py:class:: MergeProcessor

   .. py:method:: merge_added_rewards(original_file_path, save_to_temp_folder=False)

      save_to_temp_folder=True if we save to a temp folder, otherwise overwriting the original file with more entries (rewards) in each row



   .. py:method:: merge_gendata_bypattern(json_file_pattern)

      Merges JSON files matched by a specific pattern into a single file and moves it to the directory level
      one above 'temp/'. Assumes that the JSON file pattern includes a 'temp/' directory at its end
      and that all files are located within this directory. The final filename has the pattern '_*to*'
      removed before saving.

      Args:
      json_file_pattern (str): The glob pattern to match JSON files for merging.
                                Example: 'results/temp/*_val=all_*to*.json'
