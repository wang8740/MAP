        "prompt": "Task Description:\n\nIn Python, write a function named \"analyse_file_data\" that accomplishes the following:\n\n1) Open a text file named \"userdata.txt\" for reading access. This text file contains user data and each user's information is written in a new line. Each line contains username, date of birth, and email address separated by a comma. Like \"uname,dob,email\".\n\n2) Read from the file, line by line, and store data into a dictionary, where the dictionary key is the username and the value is a sublist with the date of birth at index 0 and email at index 1.\n\n3) After all data has been read from the file, the function should return the dictionary in the end. \n\nAssumptions:\n- Assume that the text file \"userdata.txt\" exists in the same directory as the script.\n- Assume that each line in the file has exactly the same pattern as described above and there are no blank lines.\n- Assume the usernames in the file are unique. \n- Assume no line in the file is empty.\n- Do not use any external libraries or modules for this task. \n\nTest your function thoroughly to ensure it's working as expected. \n\nNote: This task does not include error handling or edge case handling since that is not what's being tested here.",

The program should be able to perform the following operations:\n\n1. `read_file_content(path_to_file)`: This function should take a file path as an argument, open the file in read mode, and return all its content as a string. It should handle any exceptions related to reading the file.\n\n2. `read_file_lines(path_to_file)`: This function should take a file path as an argument, open the file in read mode, return all its lines as a list of strings. Every element in the list should represent a line in the file. It should also handle any exceptions that occur when trying to read the file.\n\n3. `count_words_in_file(path_to_file)`: This function should take a file path as an argument, open the file in read mode, count the number of words in the file and return this count. A word is defined as a set of characters separated by spaces. It should also handle any exceptions related to reading the file. \n\n4. `write_to_file(path_to_file, content)`: This method should take a file path and some content as arguments. It should open the file in write mode, write the content to it, and finally close the file. It should handle any exceptions related to writing to the file. \n\nThe functions should meet the following requirement:\n- If there is any error in opening/reading/writing the file, the functions should return count as `0`, lines as an empty list `[]` or content as `'null'`. \n\nPlease, ensure that all file operations are done using with statements, to ensure the file is automatically closed after the operations are done.",
